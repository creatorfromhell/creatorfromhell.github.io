I enjoy programming and anything tech-related. I'm currently working on Minecraft projects and some miscellaneous Game Projects, and I love implementing overkill functionality to learn new frameworks and skills. I'm in the process of setting up a Minecraft server, as I used to enjoy hosting one during the early days of Minecraft's Alpha phase. I love creating the foundation of programs by utilizing different program structures and design patterns.

## Self‑Assessment

Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have grown significantly as a developer, a problem solver, and a collaborator. The diverse coursework—from foundational programming (IT 140, CS 210) to Full Stack Development I (CS 465) and Capstone (CS 499)—has provided me with a broad and in-depth understanding of the field.

Developing my ePortfolio has been a valuable opportunity to reflect on that learning, consolidate it into tangible demonstrations of my capabilities, and position myself effectively for future employment opportunities in the tech industry.

Completing the capstone and curating the enhancements into a single survival game project allowed me to unify many threads of my education. The project draws on software engineering, data structures, database design, and game AI. It doesn’t just demonstrate isolated technical skills but showcases my ability to take a system from concept to execution, apply enhancements iteratively, and communicate technical decisions with confidence.

From a technical standpoint, I have applied principles of data structures and algorithms (CS 300, MAT 230) in the game’s entity system, AI behaviors, and procedural terrain generation. My understanding of software engineering and databases matured significantly through courses like DAD 220, CS 340, and CS 465, where I developed scalable backend components and practiced clean architecture principles.

During the capstone, I used MongoDB to implement persistent world state and player data, adding a layer of durability and complexity. Though security enforcement isn’t yet in place, I’ve considered future measures such as input validation, access control, and anti-cheat protections—especially relevant for commercial applications.

The artifacts in my ePortfolio highlight different aspects of my training and connect through a unified survival game built with Java and LibGDX:

- **Artifact 1**: Focus on modular software engineering and integration of entity behaviors.
- **Artifact 2**: Showcases proficiency in algorithms and data structures via AI and ecosystem dynamics.
- **Artifact 3**: Demonstrates database integration, including player persistence and world data caching.

Together, these artifacts form a comprehensive representation of my development skills and professional growth.

In summary, the Computer Science program has equipped me to approach real-world software problems with confidence. I’m prepared to pursue a role as a software engineer, while remaining open to specialization in cybersecurity or machine learning—areas I’ve explored through coursework (CS 305) and independent learning. My portfolio reflects technical excellence and continuous education, qualities I hope to bring to any organization.

## Artifacts

This ePortfolio showcases a single, multifaceted artifact: a procedurally generated 2D survival game enhanced across three core CS domains—software engineering, algorithms/data structures, and database systems. Originally developed in C++ for CS 330 (Computational Graphics and Visualization), the basic visual simulation evolved significantly during CS 499:

- **Original Artifact**: A 2D visual simulation with scene management and object rendering (C++).
  - [Source Code](https://github.com/creatorfromhell/CS-330/blob/main/Daniel%207-1_FinalProjectMilestones.zip)
- **Enhanced Artifact**: A survival game in Java (LibGDX), featuring:
  - AI-driven entities
  - Player controller
  - Dynamic lighting system
  - MongoDB‑backed persistence
  - [Source Code](https://github.com/creatorfromhell/IslandSurvival)
  - [Download Runnable](https://github.com/creatorfromhell/IslandSurvival)

This evolution illustrates applied knowledge in OOP, game loops, database connectivity, and behavior-based AI.

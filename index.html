            <h3>A brief summary of me</h3>
            <p>My name is Daniel Vidmar, but I'm more commonly referred to as creatorfromhell online. I have been involved in website design and development for several years now and have worked with various programming languages like Photoshop, CSS, HTML, Python, PHP, and Go to bring my clients' visions to life. My passion for design and development drives me to continuously learn new techniques and tricks to reinvent my web design and development skills. As I continue to broaden my skills, I am now more focused on being a software developer and am proficient in multiple programming languages such as Java, C#, C, C++, and Lua.

In addition to my website design and development expertise, I am also experienced in creating program structures and bases to which other developers can build upon. However, I am also capable of creating full-fledged applications. My experience and knowledge in these areas have allowed me to take on freelance work for clients looking to develop software solutions, design websites, or enhance existing applications. If you are interested in hiring me for freelance work, please feel free to contact me through my website or via email.

If you prefer a more direct approach, you can reach out to me on Discord at creatorfromhell#0666. Discord is an excellent platform for discussing freelance projects as it allows for real-time communication and the ability to share files and designs seamlessly. I am always open to new projects, and I look forward to hearing from you. Whether you need a website design, a new software application, or a program structure to build upon, I am confident that my skills and experience can help bring your vision to life. Don't hesitate to contact me to discuss your project requirements.</p>
